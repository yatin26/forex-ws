			<p style="text-align: center"><b>The foreign exchange (also known as FX or forex) market is a global marketplace for exchanging national currencies against one another.</b></p>

			<p>Because of the worldwide reach of trade, commerce, and finance, forex markets tend to be the largest and most liquid asset markets in the world. Currencies trade against each other as exchange rate pairs. For example, EUR/USD. Market participants use forex to hedge against international currency and interest rate risk, to speculate on geopolitical events, and to diversify portfolios, among several other reasons.</p>

			<p>Forex trading is an eminent part of trading currencies helping in determining the value of a specific currency; and predicting currencies is a very tough task since it requires a lot of speculating. Also, this prediction is based on multiple variables like natural calamities and economy of a nation. But in 2017 alone, in an average about $3 trillion were being traded on a daily basis.</p>

			<p>Currencies and exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, and are traded in high volumes, the primary function of trading currencies is that people need to use foreign goods and services. A lot of corporations, investors countries participate in trading currencies, they are the most liquid commodities available for exchange, and technological advancements have made this process a lot of transparent and manageable. The motive of many investors to invest money is speculation and make profit.</p>

			<p>The foreign exchange market is unique because of the following characteristics:
			<ul id="flist">
				<li>Its huge trading volume, representing the largest asset class in the world leading to high liquidity;</li>
				<li>Its geographical dispersion;</li>
				<li>Its continuous operation: 24 hours a day except for weekends, i.e., trading from 22:00 GMT on Sunday (Sydney) until 22:00 GMT Friday (New York);</li>
				<li>The variety of factors that affect exchange rates;</li>
				<li>The low margins of relative profit compared with other markets of fixed income; and</li>
				<li>The use of leverage to enhance profit and loss margins and with respect to account size.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<p>The foreign exchange market works through financial institutions and operates on several levels. Behind the scenes, banks turn to a smaller number of financial firms known as "dealers", who are involved in large quantities of foreign exchange trading. Most foreign exchange dealers are banks, so this behind-the-scenes market is sometimes called the "interbank market"</p>

			<ins><h3 style="text-align: center"><b>Difference between Forex Trading and Stock Trading</b></h3></ins>

			<p>The largest difference between forex and the stock market is, of course, what you are trading. Forex, or foreign exchange, is a marketplace for the buying and selling of currencies, while the stock market deals in shares â€“ the units of ownership in a company.</p>

			<p>Primarily, your decision about whether to trade currencies or stocks should be based on which asset you are interested in trading, but there are some other factors you need to consider. Some of these factors are:
			<ul id="slist">
				<li>Market trading hours</li>
				<li>Market influences</li>
				<li>Liquidity</li>
				<li>Volatility</li>
				<li id="last-para-forex">Leverage</li>
